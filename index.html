                I am new to programming but learning fast. Right now I am focused on Front-End part
                (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) but in my mind later on I would like to go to one of the
                machine learning fields. Could it be creating AI or image/voice recognition or Data
                Science I don’t know yet since I need to receive experience in programming first.
                Who knows may be I’ll stay with Front-End because it means always new tasks and new
                people. I am willing to learn new stuff and appreciate the IT community for being
                helpful and understanding.
