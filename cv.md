### CV of Alexey Vasilkov
* **Alexey Vasilkov**
* **Email:** _alexey.a.vasilkov@gmail.com_ ; **Discord:** _Alexey Vasilkov#8514_
* I am new to programming but learning fast. Right now I am focused on **Front-End** part (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) but in my mind later on I would like to go to one of the machine learning fields. Could it be creating **AI** or image/voice recognition or **Data Science** I don't know yet since I need to receive experience in programming first. Who knows may be I'll stay with Front-End because it means always new tasks and new people. I am willing to learn new stuff and appreciate the IT community for being helpful and understanding.
* For now I have basic knowlege of:
  * HTML; 
  * CSS;
  * JavaScript.
* I am eager to master some of the main frameworks for JavaScript such as:
	* Node; 
	* React;
	* Vue.
* [Code Sample](https://github.com/Alexey-Vasilkov/my-JS-projects/blob/master/hw5_4day.js)
* I have no prior work experience in IT field. I am attending JS courses from Andersen company. We are in the middle of writing a final project. It takes 3 people to work on that project. I will post the code when we finish.
* The courses that I am taking are Andersen course and RS School course. Also self-study on [learnjavascript](https://learn.javascript.ru) and [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com).
* My English is pretty ok since I'd been living in the US for 6 years in the past.
